    "**1. Dictionary Returns**: Tools return `{\"status\": \"success\", \"data\": ...}` or `{\"status\": \"error\", \"error_message\": ...}`  \n",
    "**2. Clear Docstrings**: LLMs use docstrings to understand when and how to use tools  \n",

    "**4. Error Handling**: Structured error responses help LLMs handle failures gracefully  \n",

    "### 🤔 3.3: Agent Tools vs Sub-Agents: What's the Difference?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a common question! Both involve using multiple agents, but they work very differently:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Agent Tools (what we're using):**\n",
    "- Agent A calls Agent B as a tool\n",
    "- Agent B's response goes **back to Agent A**\n",
    "- Agent A stays in control and continues the conversation\n",
    "- **Use case**: Delegation for specific tasks (like calculations)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sub-Agents (different pattern):**\n",
    "- Agent A transfers control **completely to Agent B**\n",
    "- Agent B takes over and handles all future user input\n",
    "- Agent A is out of the loop\n",
    "- **Use case**: Handoff to specialists (like customer support tiers)\n",
    "\n",
    "**In our currency example:** We want the currency agent to get calculation results and continue working with them, so we use **Agent Tools**, not sub-agents."
